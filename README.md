# Probability---Insurance
My portfolio about Probability in Pacmann.

# Introduction
Many people from all walks of life, including young and old, men and women, as well as other health indicators, use insurance coverage.
Also, each user group has a different number of claims (charges). These topics and the linkage of the many current groupings are the goals of this research. The insurer can change the proportion of insurance users by using the analysis of this project's outcomes to estimate the likelihood of a group with a higher fee.
